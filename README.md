## **Project Logs**

### **Project 1: JavaScript Drum Kit**
**Completed:** 04/06/20

**Lessons Learned:** 
* querySelector / querySelectorAll are ancestors of jQuery basics
* keydown/keyup are handy event listeners
* The tutorial solution:
    * showcases how to listen for targeted transitions, and
    * explains how to restart sound clip immediately 

### **Project 2: JS and CSS Clock**
**Completed:** 04/07/20

**Lessons Learned:** 
* Fun ways to manipulate elements with CSS:
    * transform & transition properties 
    * animation with cubic-bezier function
* Pulling data from Date class

### **Project 3: CSS Variables**
**Completed:** 04/08/20

**Lessons Learned:** 
* document.querySelectorAll returns NodeList (looks like array), doesn't include all Array methods, but includes native forEach()
* `dataset` object contains all data of an element with `data-` in attribute name
* When using CSS variable, you can update that variable on any element/selector that references the variable
* Same cascade rules of CCS apply (variables can be scoped/nested for greater precedence)
